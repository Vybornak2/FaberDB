# FaberDB

A Python package for fatigue life evaluation of materials.

## Introduction

FaberDB is an open-source Python package developed to assist researchers, engineers, and industry
professionals in accurately assessing material fatigue life. Its modular architecture is designed
to accommodate a variety of fatigue analysis methods, making it a versatile tool in the field of
material science.

### Key Features

- **Stress-Life** - Methods for analyzing fatigue life based on stress data
- **Strain-Life** - Tools for evaluating fatigue life using strain data
- **Energy-Life** - Methods for assessing fatigue life based on energy data

## The FABER Project

FaberDB is a key initiative of Working Group 6 (WG6) within the FABER (Fatigue Benchmark Repository) project,
operating under COST Action CA23109. The FABER project aims to create a comprehensive database of
experimental fatigue data to enhance the accuracy of fatigue life predictions.

Working Group 6 is specifically focused on developing open-source fatigue software, with FaberDB being
a flagship product of this endeavor.
